# Project1 - 2D Project
## Gunman Gavin
- A side scrolling shooter about a cowboy who wants to save the girl.
- Created by Daniel Bullock @DanBullockCS

## How to Play
- The game is controlled with the keyboard (even the menus)
- Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around
- Space to jump
- O to shoot
- P to punch (Although the punch doesn't really work, I recommend getting the gun or the games near impossible)

## Tips
- Every 5 coins you get you get 10 some health back so be sure to grab coins (You have a max health of 50, thats 5 hits)
- Coins are around the level, but they may also be hidden in certain square shaped game objects
- Be sure to grab the gun otherwise you'll be going in empty handed (literally)

## Notes
- The game was made for the 4k resolution of 3840x2160, although resizes accordingly
- Pause screen does not pause game, because that would pause the movement of the WASD buttons on the pause menu
